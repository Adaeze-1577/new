//Every loop in JavaScript is a block of code that runs repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
//Loops are used to execute a block of code a number of times.
//Loops are used to iterate over arrays and objects.
//Loops have three main parts:
//1. The initialization: This is where you define the loop variable.
//2. The condition: This is where you define the condition that must be met for the loop to continue.
//3. The increment: This is where you define how the loop variable will change after each iteration.
//PARTS OF A LOOP, THE COUNTER, THE CONDITION, THE INCREMENT
//There are three types of loops in JavaScript:

/*for (let i = 0; i <=100; i++) {
    console.log("Blockfuse Labs")
}*/
    //While loops
let counter = [2,4,6,8,10];
while (counter <= 150) {
    console.log(counter)
   counter*=3;
}
